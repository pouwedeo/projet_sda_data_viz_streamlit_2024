Read Kickstarter’s 2020 Benefit Statement — Kickstarter,"Kickstarter became a Public Benefit Corporation in 2015, breaking away from a system that prioritizes profits above all else. PBCs are for-profit companies that are obligated to consider the impact of their decisions on society as a whole, not just on shareholders. Each year we release a Benefit Statement in which we report on how well we lived up to our commitments as a PBC.

In his introductory letter to Kickstarter's 2020 Benefit Statement, CEO Aziz Hasan writes about the importance of art in hard times, and how Kickstarter creators and backers connected in innovative ways during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope you'll read the full report and that it contributes to your understanding of the PBC form as a meaningful alternative to business as usual.

Creative expression remains essential to a healthy and vibrant society.

Throughout all of the major upheavals in history, people have continued to create: whether it was making tabletop games during World War II, photographs during the Dust Bowl, literature during the plagues of the Middle Ages, or even mermaids on parade post-Hurricane Sandy.

Many creative fields were ravaged by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Kickstarter’s mission to help bring creative projects to life felt all the more urgent as galleries and museums closed, theaters and music venues halted programming, and bookstores and comic shops shuttered. We saw that creators were hesitant to try to fund their work at the outset of the crisis. The number of projects launched on our platform ground to a near-halt. We learned directly from creators that their ability to execute their Kickstarter projects suffered, and that they were facing a loss of income that would impact their ability to develop creative work.

Yet we also saw that the desire to support creative work on Kickstarter never wavered. Backers remained eager to contribute, and after a few months, we began to see more people launch projects again. The folks behind the beloved Saint Vitus Bar in Brooklyn found tremendous success by using Kickstarter to connect with their community while they were closed. The Wide Awakes marched through cities across the United States to build a joyful, creative, hopeful movement for a better world. Meanwhile, projects that were funded in previous years came to life in 2020, and reminded us of what’s possible. Hair Love, a heartwarming short film that tells the story of a Black father learning to style his young daughter’s hair, won the Oscar for Best Animated Short.

COVID affected some creative fields more than others. Games, Publishing, Comics, and Art continued to thrive on Kickstarter, while forms that rely far more on in-person collaboration and performance—Dance, Theater, Music, and Film—were all hit much harder and have yet to fully recover, more than a year later. (See the report's section on Creative Projects Funded in 2020 for more detail.)

While fewer creators came to the platform in the wake of COVID, those who did launch saw more support than ever from backers. Collectively, these backers—50 percent of them new to Kickstarter—pledged more money to fund creative work in 2020 than ever before. Nearly 3.5 million people pledged a total of $777,750,950 to independent creators. Together, they funded 18,744 creative projects.

These numbers feel especially profound in a year when nothing could be taken for granted, and they add to the cumulative impact of what’s been realized through the Kickstarter platform since our founding. From 2009 through 2020, nearly 19 million people pledged over $5.4 billion to more than 190,000 projects. $4.8 billion went to projects that reached their funding goals, and of that total, $4.6 billion went directly into the hands of creators. Every dollar pledged has had exponential ripple effects. Kickstarter projects are estimated to have created 750,000+ part-time jobs, 80,000+ full-time jobs, more than 20,000 companies, and $13.5B in additional economic impact. (See the report's section on Economic Impact for more information).

This progress toward our mission is what’s most important to us. We took the radical step of incorporating as a Public Benefit Corporation in 2015 to legally bind ourselves to the pursuit of our mission—and to protect ourselves from the legal obligation that most corporations have: to maximize profit above all else.

When we did this, we also made commitments to create additional public benefits and ensure our operations are fair and responsible. As part of our commitment to fight inequality, we publish our executive and CEO pay ratios. The average CEO earns at least 320 times that of the median worker at the same company. In 2020, our ratio was 2.8 to 1. To limit our environmental impact, in 2020 we encouraged more creators to detail their own environmental commitments on their Kickstarter project pages; as a result, 49 percent of eligible projects did so, a dramatic increase from the 18 percent we saw in 2019. And to support a more creative and equitable world, every year we donate five percent of our after-tax profits to programs and organizations addressing systemic inequality. In 2020, a year that marked a turning point in the conversation around racial injustice in the United States and around the world, $475,000 went to this purpose.

Kickstarter creator Steve Locke wrote, “Whether created for mass audiences or an individual working alone in their studio, artists manifest the culture in which we all live.” At Kickstarter we believe that art and creative expression are essential to a healthy and vibrant society. They bring beauty, humor, and joy into our lives. They challenge us and authority. They help us face, and escape, the truths of our world. The value of creative work is intrinsic and unchanging. I felt it more than ever in 2020, and looking back at the year on our platform, I know I’m far from alone."
